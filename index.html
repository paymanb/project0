        <h3>Books</h3>

            <p id="mainParaph">Even if you have read one good book in your life, you will know what reading gives. It gives you incomparable pleasure. While there is no doubt about the fact that reading is a priceless activity, it has been observed that the habit of reading has declined of late. One of the main causes for this decline is the growth of technology. However, what most people dont know is there is so much to benefit from reading. Here are 30 reasons of reading books</p>
            <ol>
                <li><h5>Gives knowledge</h5></li>
                <p>One of the biggest reasons why we read books is to gain knowledge. Books are a rich source of information. Reading books on varied subjects imparts information and increases the depth about the subject as well. Whenever you read a book, you learn a new information that otherwise would not have known.</p>
            
                <li><h5>Improves your brain</h5></li>
                <p>Studies have shown that reading has strong positive effects on the brain. By staying mentally stimulated, you can prevent dementia and Alzheimerâ€™s disease. This is because, keeping your brain active prevents it from losing power. The brain is a muscle and like other muscles in the body, exercise keeps it strong and healthy. Similar to solving puzzles, reading books is a great way to exercise your brain and keep it healthy.</p>
            
                <li><h5>Reduces stress</h5></li>
                <p>Reading has a positive effect on the body as well. Reading a book can relieve stress better than taking a walk or listening to music. According to studies who read more tend to have lower stress levels.</p>
